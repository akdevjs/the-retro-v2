          "These are highly rated so I thought Id buy them for jogging. Because of foot problems, I usually have to substitute the footbed in the shoe for an orthotic.I tried these on and they look pretty good and feel pretty good. The sole on them is a little harder and more supportive than other shoes, which I like. Unfortunately, I would still need to use an orthotic to jog in these, as the footbed is somewhat flat and not overly arch-supportive. That's not to say they are a bad shoe, quite the opposite, they are really good.So, currently I'm using them as my biking shoe (mountain, road) and they work great for that. Probably a pretty good walking shoe. Not so sure about using them as a true running shoe, depends on your needs for support.",

So, I have to agree with my husband and even tell him he was right for once, lol. So, I bought myself a pair, they fit perfectly, feel great, high quality.",

Typically I start wearing a sneaker out within the first month of use, however, in the weeks that I've owned this and after walking several dozen miles in them there's almost no signs of wear or tear. If you are on a budget, buy these.I wouldn't work out in them as they are high soled and you could get a nasty sprain running in these (also kind of heavy).",

          "I got these for a nice looking pair of shoes on the weekends. I have size 14 4E feet. They are comfortable enough to wear around for a day. Over all I am happy with them. I will say though, my feet are wide and it is hard to find a 4E that is still wide enough and actually fits. I'm a Dunham, Brooks, Hoka 4E person. These brands, my little toe does not rub the outside. Asics, Saucony, New Balance, all of those 4E my little toe is still squished against the side. That is the case with these as well. So, if those brands fit you, these will be just fine. If those brands are slightly snug on you, these will be too. The length is spot on. The only other ding i'd give it is as soft and flexible as the sides are, really nice, the big logo on the side is fairly rigid and you can feel it on the side of your foot. Not rubbing to the point of blisters or anything, but you definitely know there's a big logo on the side of your shoe.",

Wouldn't do anything longer than 15k on them, will never brake a personal record on them, but they cost at least half the price of all my other running shoes, which make this pair a pretty good option for daily trainers.

          "As a long time WFH employee, I had gotten in a habit of buying cheaper and cheaper shoes because I wasn't really on my feet on a daily basis. These shoes are reminding me why that is such. A bad idea...These shoes are a performance running shoe but I use them for daily wear and about 3 to 4 walks per week. I can't think of any cons at this point.They are super light but they also provide very good foot support. I feel like the width is just right and the uppers are light but also prevent lateral sliding. Most sneakers that I wore in the past were either light or supportive but not both. It might be because the shoe does seem to fit my foot perfectly. I know that might not be the case for everyone else.I would definitely recommend these, especially since the price won't break the bank.",

If you've been to Vegas, you know you walk a tremendous amount up and down the strip. We were there for 10 days and I used these shoes every day and it felt like I was walking on air! We've been to vegas before and I've had expensive running shoes (maybe that was the problem) that made my feet go numb after walking more than an hour, but these did not.I was skeptical about size due to I wear a wide 10.5, but these fit perfectly. They weren't too tight, nor too loose. I purchased the black ones so as not to notice if they got dirty and after 10 days, they were still pristine. They also blended well with casual and dress attire. My only negative or regret about these is that I didn't buy a second pair at the sale price!Do yourself a favor and buy these! You won't regret it and will be in awe of how comfortable these are to walk in, especially over long distances!",

They were so comfortable I was reluctant to get a new pair until it was pointed out to me just how worn out they were. I was afraid the new ones wouldn’t be the same as the old ones. I am happy to report how misplaced that concern was. These shoes are absolute heaven to walk in. I have other kinds of shoes that easily cost three times as much as these but don’t come anywhere close in terms of comfort. Now I’m honestly considering switching all my shoes over to Skechers. I don’t understand what makes them so great, I just accept it as a reality. Money well spent.",

Interestingly, this has never been the case with any of the discount-store clones I've worn for the past 10 years- their problem is being more slippery than ice when worn-out. Hopefully that's not the fate of these!Also, these are a little loose compared to what I'm used to with a 10.5; with the discount-store clones I'll go up to 11 and still fee very stable for the life of the shoe.

Though I got laced ones but if I keep the laces a bit loose, I can use it like slipons without any problem. In one word I like these shoes very much and highly recommend it.",

          'I got these on sale on Amazon and ordered more than one size based on reviews that some said fit just right and others said runs large. It definitely runs on the larger size. My son usually wears a 12 or a 11.5 W and neither one of those fit right and were too big and sloppy on his feet, with the heel sliding up and down. The 11.5 regular I bought for my husband fits him better but still slides up and down on the heel. The 11.5 was also way too big on my husband, even though that is his regular size had about 3/4" between the heal and his foot. My son says the soles, however, are comfortable and worked well when he was on his feet all day for work. Comfortable right out of the box and do not require breaking in. I gave 4 star for the comfort, but the sizing is definitely off compared to usual sizes.',

I’m up to 4 pairs at this point and I really can’t begin to explain how much of a game changer these shoes are for me. The mesh fabric breathes like there isn’t anything there, super fast on/off & they are super easy to care for. For the price point, do yourself a favor and get 2 or 3 pairs right off the bat! You won’t be disappointed!Full Disclosure: I am and have been, for 20+ years, an Adidas Fanatic.",

This version of the Adidas Lite Racer Adapt 3.0 is a bit wider fit than the original show was. But it is not a downside at all. The wider space makes the walking a bit more padded and cloud stepping feel when walking.Quick Comments- If you want a shoe comfortable for long work hours on your feet this shoe is perfect for you.(The only reason this was not a 5/5 was because I wish the laces on the front were designed a bit differently, but that is just my personal opinion)",

It stays conformed to my foot and grabs my foot when running and relaxes it when standing. It is super comfortable and I highly recommend it.

Just think about how many times do you actually lace your shoes out of millions times you put them on and take them off throughout the day, probably almost never, so whats the point? These ones look very stylish, very soft and comfortable, don't have an over-engineered outsole, therefore, easy to clean. Best thing about them is you can literally put them on without bending over and even touching the shoe with your hands, while at the same time still they are able to stay on firmly.",

I didn't like them because the sole was smaller than the shoes and it looked like a sprained ankle in the making if she started running. We sent them back. They fit the same at what you would wear.",

I’m up to 4 pairs at this point and I really can’t begin to explain how much of a game changer these shoes are for me. The mesh fabric breathes like there isn’t anything there, super fast on/off & they are super easy to care for. For the price point, do yourself a favor and get 2 or 3 pairs right off the bat! You won’t be disappointed!Full Disclosure: I am and have been, for 20+ years, an Adidas Fanatic.",

This version of the Adidas Lite Racer Adapt 3.0 is a bit wider fit than the original show was. But it is not a downside at all. The wider space makes the walking a bit more padded and cloud stepping feel when walking.Quick Comments- If you want a shoe comfortable for long work hours on your feet this shoe is perfect for you.(The only reason this was not a 5/5 was because I wish the laces on the front were designed a bit differently, but that is just my personal opinion)",

It stays conformed to my foot and grabs my foot when running and relaxes it when standing. It is super comfortable and I highly recommend it. For those that are physically active, have to stand a lot or move around a lot daily, or workout heavily.",

Just think about how many times do you actually lace your shoes out of millions times you put them on and take them off throughout the day, probably almost never, so whats the point? These ones look very stylish, very soft and comfortable, don't have an over-engineered outsole, therefore, easy to clean. Best thing about them is you can literally put them on without bending over and even touching the shoe with your hands, while at the same time still they are able to stay on firmly.",
